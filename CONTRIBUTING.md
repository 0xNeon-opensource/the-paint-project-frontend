# Contributing

Just let me know before you work on something by opening an issue or commenting on an existing one.
I don't want your effort to be wasted!

Open issues! Issues for features, issues for problems...

Feel free to open issues in a "meta" context, like "hey, maybe you should tag issues with 'good first issue'" etc.

### Project Structure

it's messy; a lot of stuff is in a file simply called "functions.js" (to give you an idea of it)

I can go into more detail [if you want..](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/issues)
